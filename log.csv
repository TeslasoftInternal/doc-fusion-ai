The motivation is to address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models by reducing training and inference costs. The project aims to modify an existing model to use fewer resources and operate more efficiently. Data for the project will be based on replicating a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model described in a specific article, with the goal of finding suitable datasets. The team intends to use the VizDoom engine and RL technology, aiming to replace an existing model with a diffusion model detailed in an academic paper. Relevant literature includes articles on diffusion models and the VizDoom platform. The project's success will be evaluated by measuring metrics such as framerate, CPU/GPU usage, and training time."
